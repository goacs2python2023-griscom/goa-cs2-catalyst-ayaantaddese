# Overview of GitHub Repository

This GitHub repository contains code to produce two insightful visualizations using scatter plots to analyze different aspects of global connectivity and GDP. The first visualization displays a scatter plot comparing the top 100 most connected country pairs with their average GDP per capita. The x-axis shows the average GDP per capita (in USD), while the y-axis represents the number of direct flight connections. The plot uses a consistent point size of 10 and a color map (Spectral6 palette) to represent the number of connections. A HoverTool displays tooltips with information about the countries, average GDP per capita, and number of connections when hovering over a point. Beneath the scatter plot, a text box (Div) lists the top 10 most connected country pairs, summarizing the visualized data.

The second visualization highlights the relationship between the GDP of nations and the number of countries they are directly connected to by flights. The x-axis uses a logarithmic scale to represent GDP in USD, while the y-axis indicates the number of direct flight connections. The plot features blue circles with a consistent size of 10 and alpha transparency of 0.6. A HoverTool is included to display tooltips with country-specific data such as GDP and connections. A red trendline, calculated using a log-log linear regression, is added to demonstrate the correlation between variables, and its equation along with the R^2 value is shown in an information Div below the plot. A toggle button allows users to control the visibility of the trendline. The overall layout consists of the scatter plot, the information Div with trendline data, and the toggle button, arranged in a column.
